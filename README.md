    quick <repo-url>
    
or 
    
    quick <repo-url> [-c{custom folder name}] [-e{editor name}]
    
## Or this ðŸ¥µðŸ¥µðŸ¥µ
    
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd repo-name
    code .
    ----open terminal in vs code----
    npm install

## Additional options
Editor and Custom folder names are optional.
### Open the code in your favorite IDE
If no parameter is passed, by default folder will be opened in Visual Studio Code
As editor name :

1. Use **c** for Visual Studio Code
    ```sh
    quick <repo-url> -ec
    ```
2. Use **a** for Atom
    ```sh
    quick <repo-url> -ea
    ```

### For cloning into a custom named folder :
```sh
quick <repo-url> [-c{custom folder name}]
```
Example :
```sh
quick https://github.com/Tanmay000009/git-ultimate-cloner/ -cCustom-Named-Folder
```
The package will clone the repository into a folder named "Custom-Named-Folder". And will by default open the code in Visual Studio Code, as no parameter has been passed with `-e`.
